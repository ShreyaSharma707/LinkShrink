# 🔗 LinkShrink

A full-stack URL management application built with **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, **Redis**, and **BullMQ**.

It supports secure authentication, anonymous and authenticated URL shortening, Redis-powered caching, asynchronous click analytics, and a modern dashboard for managing shortened URLs. It is designed with scalability, performance, and clean architecture in mind.

## 🏛️ System Design Decisions

### Redis Caching
- Frequently accessed short URLs are cached in Redis to minimize MongoDB queries and improve redirect performance.

### Asynchronous Click Analytics
- Click events are processed using BullMQ background workers, ensuring that analytics updates do not delay user redirects.

### Stateless Backend
- The backend is stateless, allowing multiple application instances to run behind a load balancer for horizontal scaling.

### Secure Authentication
- JWT tokens are stored in HttpOnly cookies to reduce exposure to client-side scripts.

### Database
- MongoDB Atlas is used as the primary persistent data store for users, URLs, and analytics.


# 📚 API Documentation

## Base URL

### Production

```text
https://url-shortener-fqv4.onrender.com
```

### Local Development

```text

# Authentication

Authentication is handled using **JWT stored in HttpOnly Cookies**.

After a successful login or registration, the backend automatically sets the authentication cookie.
